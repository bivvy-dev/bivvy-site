# Install via npm

Install Bivvy using npm, yarn, or pnpm.

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install -g bivvy-cli

# yarn
yarn global add bivvy-cli

# pnpm
pnpm add -g bivvy-cli
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 14 or later
- curl (used to download the native binary)

## Supported Platforms

| OS | Architecture |
|----|--------------|
| macOS | x64 (Intel), arm64 (Apple Silicon) |
| Linux | x64, arm64 |
| Windows | x64 |

## How It Works

The npm package is a thin wrapper that:
1. Downloads the native Bivvy binary on `npm install` (via a postinstall script)
2. Provides a Node.js wrapper at `bin/bivvy` that spawns the native binary

This gives you the performance of a native binary with the convenience of npm.

## Updating

```bash
npm update -g bivvy-cli
```

## Uninstalling

```bash
npm uninstall -g bivvy-cli
```
