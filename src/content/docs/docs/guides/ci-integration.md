---

Bivvy's lint command supports SARIF output format, which is widely supported
by CI/CD systems and IDEs for displaying static analysis results.

## GitHub Actions

Upload SARIF results to GitHub Code Scanning:

```yaml
- name: Lint Bivvy config
  run: bivvy lint --format=sarif > bivvy.sarif

- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
  with:
    sarif_file: bivvy.sarif
```

## GitLab CI

Export lint results as a report artifact:

```yaml
lint:
  script:
    - bivvy lint --format=json > bivvy-lint.json
  artifacts:
    reports:
      codequality: bivvy-lint.json
```

## VS Code

Use the [SARIF Viewer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-SarifVSCode.sarif-viewer)
to view lint results directly in your editor:

1. Install the SARIF Viewer extension
2. Run `bivvy lint --format=sarif > .bivvy/lint.sarif`
3. Open the SARIF file to see issues in the editor

## Exit Codes

The lint command returns:
- `0` - No errors (warnings allowed)
- `1` - One or more errors found
- `2` - Configuration loading error

Use `--strict` to treat warnings as errors.
